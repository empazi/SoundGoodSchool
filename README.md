This is an SQL database made using postgreSQL. It is based on a imaginary company teaching musical instruments to students.
The DB is designed to keep track of:
*Lesson records per student and instructors
*Current lease contracts of instruments to students
*Skilllevel of student and instructor in a specific instrument
*And more!

CREATE_DB_SCRIPT.txt is all that is really needed to create the DB, the other .sql files are placeholder objects made for testing.
Project2.1INHERIT.sql is the same DB but utilizes inheritance in constructing the DB.
